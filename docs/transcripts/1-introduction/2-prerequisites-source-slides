In this video, we are going to learn the prerequisites for this course, how to access the source code

and where to find the course slides.

First, let's talk about the prerequisites.

In order to follow this course effectively, there are a few tools that you need.

The first one is dotnet nine, dotnet nine is the foundation of everything we will be doing in this

course.

It includes the.

Net aspire framework as part of the default setup, which is we will leverage for building cloud native

distributed applications.

So during the course we use Net nine features extensively.

You can follow the course greater than Net nine versions.

And the second tool that we need Visual Studio 2022 or later we will use Visual Studio 2022 or later

editions as your primary IDE.

Make sure to include ASP.Net web development and the dotnet aspire workload during the installation.

We will use it for coding, debugging, and testing our cloud native distributed application development.

And after that we need Docker Desktop.

Docker desktop is essential for containerizing, our application and cloud native baking services.

DotNet aspire framework used Docker Desktop on behind the scenes in order to run distributed application

in a containerized environment.

So that means instead of the configuring manually Docker compose YAML files, we will rely on dotnet

aspires built in orchestration.

So you can download and install these tools.

You can use the link on the slide to download these prerequisites.

So please install and download these prerequisites before proceeding to course.

Next we will talk about the source code.

All the source code written and demonstrated in this course is available on GitHub.

This course comes with from a live GitHub repository that dotnet community develop and grow together.

I'll provide the repository link on the slide.

Feel free to download, explore and even contribute to it.

You can also download the source code section by section, every section code separated in this repository.

By this way, you can jump to the section and continue developments where you left without hesitating

to starting from the beginning.

And lastly, the course slides.

Each lecture comes with detailed slides summarizing the key points and concepts.

These slides are available for download in this Lecture Resources section that you can see on the slide

picture.

How you can download from the lecture resources.

We can click here and download the resources.

I highly encourage you to download and review them as you progress through the course.
