In this video we are going to learn dotnet core concepts.

DotNet aspire has three main concepts.

These are the orchestration, integrations and service discovery.

Let me start with the orchestration in dotnet aspire.

Orchestration in dotnet aspire is all about automating how your microservices are started, scaled and

managed.

That means it provides automating container management.

Each microservices and it is required.

Backing services are containerized automatically.

DotNet aspire is to automate container based deployments without requiring manual Docker files or complex

docker-compose.yaml setups for each microservices.

When you run an aspire project, it automatically orchestrates your containers and baking services so

they all spin up in a union way.

And the second orchestration feature is Environment Awareness.

Aspire.

Adjust these configurations for development, staging or production environments, ensuring Inconsistencies

at every stage of deployment.

Aspire uses environment configuration to decide what services to start and how to configure them.

This means your development team can run a fully containerized setup locally, and also it includes

service dependencies.

If a microservice needs to wait for a database to spin up.

Aspire can coordinate that.

By this way, microservices don't fail on startup because their dependencies aren't ready.

And another feature is scalable infrastructure.

By relying on orchestration, The.net aspire makes it straightforward to scale individual microservices,

whether you are using Docker, Kubernetes, or Azure Container apps.

Aspire manage the foundational scripts and tooling, letting you focus on writing code rather than dealing

with the container complexities.

So when you run an aspire project, it orchestrates all the moving parts for you, letting you concentrate

on building features rather than wrestling with the infrastructure details.

And the second core concept is integrations in.

Net aspire, and it has come with the built in connectors.

Net aspire includes pre-built integrations with common Cloud and on premise services such as databases,

caches, message workers, and identity providers.

And this reduces the boilerplate code required to configure each service in your application.

Common services like PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Keycloak can be added with minimal code.

No extra Docker files needed.

And also it comes with the crosscutting features, and the framework also provides default setup for

the logging, monitoring and telemetry that is saving time and promoting consistent patterns across

different microservices.

You don't need to start from scratch when implementing new capabilities.

Aspire handle much of the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

Logging, telemetry, and monitoring integrations are also part of the aspire offering, ensuring consistent

approach across multiple microservices.

And also it is modular and extensible.

These integrations are modular, so you only bring in what you need.

Adding a new services like AI based features or vector databases require minimal adjustments.

Thanks to Aspire's pluggable design, you only bring in the services that you need.

Aspire's design lets you plug in without rewriting the core components.

These integrations save your time and promote best practices from day one.

And the last core component is service discovery in dotnet aspire, and it comes with the dynamic routing.

In distributed microservice environment, service endpoints can change dynamically, for instance when

scaling up or down.

DotNet aspire addresses this problem with the service discovery mechanism that keeps track of the microservice

locations, avoiding the need for the hard coded URL or IP addresses, and it has also automatic registration.

When each microservice starts, it registers itself in aspire.

Service discovery or a backing service registry, making it is comparable to other services, and these

registry tracks active instances and also it provides resilience and scaling.

Service discovery also enables load balancing and failover.

If one instance of the service becomes unavailable, it calls are routed to another instance automatically

and increasing resiliency and ensuring uninterrupted services for the end users.

So if you combine all these three core concepts in dotnet aspire, we can say that orchestration ensures

each service and backing services is containerized and started in the correct order, and integrations

lets you effortlessly add databases, caches, messaging systems or identity providers as a backing

services and service discovery binds everything together, allowing microservices to find each other

without manual configuration.

This synergy makes To.net Aspire an excellent choice for the teams who want to build cloud native and

event driven distributed solutions quickly and reliably.
